		<P>assessed, thus driving the RHA towards the right strategic decisions.</P>
		<P>In order to meet and populate the above-mentioned KPIs a regional healthcare authority
			has to implement a complex information technology system in order to gather up all
			needed information. Then the information collected through the use of enterprise
			resource planning software, hospital information systems, clinical information systems,
			radiology information system, and laboratory information systems has to be processed
			and interpolated to produce the final metadata set from which the KPIs are driven. In other
			words, the model is complemented by a business intelligence solution similar to the one
			depicted in Figure 4.</P>
		<P>Figure 4 shows how data are collected from the various data sources, cleansed and
			homogenised, and finally redistributed to the knowledge workers and decision makers
			of the regional healthcare authority (Extraction, Transformation and Load—ETL).</P>
		<P>The data collection process is extremely important since it is a basic feature of successfully populating the KPIs. In that sense both organizational and technological issues to
			achieve data quality should be considered. In the proposed setting, the regional
			healthcare authority has imposed on its healthcare units the use of specific classifications, codifications and taxonomies such as the 10th edition of the International Classification of diseases (ICD10). In addition, the proposed KPIs can be seen as attributes of
			structure, process or outcome (based upon the Donabedian approach) so that they can
			be used to draw an inference about quality. As such the KPIs are proposed, designed,
			tested and assessed by a panel of experts (executive officers of the RHA, practitioners).
			By implementing this organizational structure the quality level of the proposed KPIs is
			such that technological issues are greatly reduced.</P>

		<p>Up to this point, this chapter has mostly dealt with organizational and strategic features
			of knowledge management in healthcare. In the proposed use case we have shown an
			ongoing implementation of a Balanced Scorecard Framework in a regional healthcare
			authority environment. This has been done intentionally wishing to state that the
			technological part on such an implementation is probably the less important issue. If one
			regards the future trends in knowledge management, one can see that a multitude of new
			tools are already proposed for use. This chapter will briefly set the focus on the trends
			that to our knowledge are the most promising and present more opportunities to
			healthcare organizations in creating effective performance management facilities.</p>
		
		<h3 style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Service Oriented Architecture and Patient-Centered Architecture<br/>
				(Based on the Electronic Health Record)</i></h3><hr/>
		<p>The term of patient-centered architecture has been already in the literature for some
			years. Many techniques have been used in the past such as Corbamed (Object Management Group, 2001) and Distributed Healthcare environment (DHE). The introduction of
			web technologies such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML), the Simple Object
			Access Protocol (SOAP), the Web Services Description Language (WDSL), and more
			precisely the concept of Web Services (Deitel, Deitel, DuWaldt, &amp; Trees, 2003; W3C,
			2003) are driving information technologies towards a Service Oriented Architecture
			(SOA).</p>
		<p>A service is a software component that is suitable for cross-application access. A service
			is never a complete application or transaction. It is always a building block. SOA is the
			architecture of an application that uses services. Services define reusable business
			functions; SOA binds services into applications. Logically, services are defined by their
			interfaces. Technically, services are defined by their implementations (sometimes complex integrated flows, other times a single simple program). SOA is a logical concept, and
			its design is focused on the definition of service interfaces and interactions between
			service interfaces. Fundamental to SOA is the loose coupling between its components.
			At the logical level, this translates to the ability to add a new service for the end-user
			unobtrusively to the service provider. At the technical level, this translates to the ability
			of software developers to deploy a new application that calls a service without the need
			to redeploy or change the service. The use of SOA will allow the creation of processbased components of applications that will manipulate knowledge and information based
			upon the processes and the required or designed outcomes.</p>
		
		<h3 style="font-weight: 500;"><i>The Semantic Web</i></h3><hr/>
		<p>The Semantic Web goes beyond the World Wide Web by encoding knowledge using a
			structured, logically connected representation, and by providing sets of inference rules
			that can be used to conduct automated reasoning. Whilst the idea of knowledge representation languages is not new, existing languages generally use their own set of
			ontologies and inference rules to identify and eliminate logical contradictions and
			inconsistencies. The Resource Description Framework—RDF (W3C, 2003) and XML
			Topic Maps (TopicMaps.Org, 2001) are the most promising tools towards the implementation of the Semantic Web in practice. Nevertheless, a long way towards maturity has
			still to be covered since issues such as specific metadata frameworks and data quality
			are not yet solved. In any case, the Semantic Web should enhance the promotion of
			clinical practice guidelines and evidence based medicine. They can be seen as taxonomies of medical cases that could be both used for performance monitoring (in respect to
			commonly agreed levels of delivered care) and decision support for the healthcare
			practitioners.
			</p>
		<h3 style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Critical Pathways</i></h3><hr/>
		<p>Critical Pathways (Wall & Proyect, 1998) are mechanisms for transforming a reactive
			bureaucratic ritual to a dynamic, indispensable, clinical improvement process. A critical
			pathway when established is a mechanism for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Integrating continuous quality improvements with traditional patients’ care review</li>
			<li>Managing and impacting of clinical and financial outcomes for a specific treatment
				procedure</li>
			<li>Proactively addressing economic and regulatory changes</li>
			<li>Improving clinical outcomes through reduction in variation</li>
			<li>Controlling unnecessary cost and resource usage without jeopardising quality of
				care</li>
			<li>Fostering multi-disciplinary approach to patient care</li>
			<li>Linking quality management to staff education</li>
			<li>Managing limited financial resources</li>
			<li>Making efficient use of scarce organizational resources</li>
			<li>Increasing readiness for anticipated changed in healthcare</li>
			<li>Applying and using clinical practice guidelines and other taxonomies set up by
				different professional societies</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Critical Pathways can be seen as “specialized” performance management tools that
			would provide a BSC framework with very specific performance indicators for each
			treatment or clinical process.
			</p>
		<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px;"><b>Conclusions</b></h1><hr style="border: 2px solid black;" />
		<p>Performance management is a key issue in the continuous process of delivering high
			quality healthcare services. The use of KPIs has proved that the design of a Balance
			Scorecard acts as the “cockpit” of a regional (or national) healthcare authority where all
			metrics are the flight instruments enabling the provision of healthcare based upon equity,
			financial control, continuous process and structure refinement, and outcome measurements. In that sense, the proposed infrastructure is, technologically speaking, an
			important knowledge management tool that enables knowledge sharing amongst various
			healthcare stakeholders and between different healthcare groups. The use of BSC is an
			enabling framework towards a knowledge management strategy in healthcare since KM
			is about discovering knowledge from existing information, about creating new knowledge and about implementing processes and taxonomies that enable the reuse and
			assessment of information as part and bits of knowledge.</p>
		<p>Knowledge can be seen as a performance management tool both for administrative
			purposes and clinical improvements.</p>
		<p>During the implementation process of deploying a technological platform for performance management or any other type of 			knowledge management infrastructure, one must
			have in mind that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The six issues described in the introduction section must being taken into strong
				consideration from day one.</li>
			<li>It is important to focus on people, processes and outcomes, and to set-up a straightforward strategy to plan, manage, assess, educate, disseminate, and maintain the
				developed BSC framework.</li>
			<li>Any type of knowledge management project bases its success on continuous
				improvement and assessment. Metrics and processes are meant to change in order
				to reflect improvements towards quality of healthcare.</li>
			<li>The knowledge and technology is there, but still very limited best practices have
				been successfully implemented.</li>
			<li>The implementation of BSC framework is a time consuming process that has to
				involve all stakeholders’ representatives.</li>
